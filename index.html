  <!--Content for Changes and Why-->
  <p id ="reg_plastic_bottles" class="changes_why_content">Regular Plastic Bottles are boring and overated, destroying the environment without even looking fashionable? Disgusting. </p>
  <p id ="reg_plastic_bottles2" class="changes_why_content">The boring straight cylinders used, not only are depressing to look at but kill the environment slowly. Like islands made of plastic? Atleast have the plastic be in silly shapes</p>
  <p id ="reg_plastic_bottles3" class="changes_why_content">The straight cylinders not only look vial in those rafts made out of plastic but, use more surface area than other designs meaning more plastic is used</p>
  <p id ="reg_plastic_bottles4" class="changes_why_content">Although the solution is quite simple, to merely choose a different shape. Bags and other devices have been accustomed to these bottle designs</p>
  <p id ="reg_plastic_bottles5" class="changes_why_content">But this new bottle finds a solution, based around flasks, the bottle can be strapped on, not having pesky handles but instead a simple strap, taking up less surface area, and making me throw my computer trying to code the design in</p>

Sphere having 2/3d volume, big truncated cone having 2/3(1/3) volume and small truncated cone having the remainder 1/3(1/3) volume.
