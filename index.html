  <!--Content for Changes and Why-->
  <p id ="reg_plastic_bottles" class="changes_why_content">Regular Plastic Bottles are boring and overated, destroying the environment without even looking fashionable? Disgusting. </p>
  <p id ="reg_plastic_bottles2" class="changes_why_content">The boring straight cylinders used, not only are depressing to look at but kill the environment slowly. Like islands made of plastic? Atleast have the plastic be in silly shapes</p>
  <p id ="reg_plastic_bottles3" class="changes_why_content">The straight cylinders not only look vial in those rafts made out of plastic but, use more surface area than other designs meaning more plastic is used</p>
  <p id ="reg_plastic_bottles4" class="changes_why_content">Although the solution is quite simple, to merely choose a different shape. Bags and other devices have been accustomed to these bottle designs</p>
  <p id ="reg_plastic_bottles5" class="changes_why_content">But this new bottle finds a solution, based around flasks, the bottle can be strapped on, not having pesky handles but instead a simple strap, taking up less surface area, and making me throw my computer trying to code the design in</p>

 <!-- <p id="help_me_text" class="help_me">Since Sphere has biggest volume, I'm taking 2/3 of the original divided volume to make the sphere volume</p>
  <p id="help_me_text2" class="help_me2">Due to one truncated cone being bigger than the other, I divide by three to then be able to multiply one of the values by two for one volume, and have the remainder value as the smaller volume</p>
  <p id="help_me_text3" class="help_me3">For the bigger Truncated cone I'm combining 2 outta the three values, to get a bigger volume than the smaller truncated cone</p>
  <p id="background" class="math_involved_content" class="help_me_god">Doing it by hand because I like to gamble, I just made up the ratios. Sphere having 2/3d volume, big truncated cone having 2/3(1/3) volume and small truncated cone having the remainder 1/3(1/3) volume. Ofc in building the 3d objects, the circumference will have to be involved to get a good visual.</p>
